### Additional Tips for ATS-Optimized Resumes:
- **Avoid Graphics and Images**: ATS cannot read graphics or images. Stick to text.
- **Simple Section Headers**: Use clear and standard headers like "Experience," "Education," "Skills," "Projects."
- **Standard File Format**: Save your resume as a .pdf or .docx for best compatibility.
- **No Fancy Formatting**: Avoid tables, text boxes, or multi-column layouts that might confuse the ATS.

## 4. Compile the Resume

After making your changes, compile the LaTeX code to generate a PDF. On Overleaf, this is done automatically when you save your changes.

## 5. Download or Share

Once you are happy with the result, you can download the resume as a PDF or share the link to your Overleaf project.
